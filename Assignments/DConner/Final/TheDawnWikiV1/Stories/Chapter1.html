      <h1 class="centerr header2">Chapter 1: That which lurks beyond</h1>
      <br/>
      <p class="story">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I sit here in this corner, cowering in fear of what lurks beyond my chamber door, I can’t help but feel somewhat responsible for my current situation. My friend of seven years lay strewn about over fifteen feet of this room, I can’t quite bring myself to say that he didn’t deserve it. The door knocks echo like the eternal sounds of a lucid dream. One two three. One two three. One two three. I hold my breath, praying to any god that will hear me. The creature’s boots continue down the hall, leaving me to lament. As I thought back, I realize that everything had in one way or another lead to this. The piles of books and papers that filled this study hold blood in both their bindings and their words. The loud bell of the grandfather clock can be heard several rooms away, twelve times it rings for midnight. I breathe easier knowing that at least I am safe for another day…<br/><br/><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</span><br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything started twenty years ago, I was but a young lad of twenty-five. My late father had left my brothers and I with a fairly expansive estate split between us and the various town he so frequently traveled. While my brothers were given exquisite pieces of land outside the kingdom’s capital, in key trading outposts of the land, or inside cities of historical legend, I was given a small plot of land within the city of Mercy. Mercy was a beautiful town, sure, so long as one overlooked where it stood. Three out of the four city gates lead out into an eternal swampland extending clear to the south sea, meaning that for the typical horse and buggy there was one way in and one way out. Even our funnel of a gate wasn’t so bad. It knew exactly what it was and was designed with that in mind, being large enough to accommodate even the most well endowed of dragons to pass through with enough room to stretch. The bad part was that the other three gates existed. These other gates allowed for droves of swampland husks, undead corpses of those who die in the swamp, to lumber right into our streets; If it weren’t for the soldiers that were posted at those gates at all hours, they most certainly would have.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ruling body of Mercy, the Nobel HollowWind family, never once allowed the gates to be blocked off. Their reasons mostly financial or, depending on if you ask the priest of the family, for religious reasons. The family lived in the centermost district of town, keeping those with any screws left far enough away from the ever-looming threat of the swamp. A few however decided, for one reason or another, to live a little closer to the edges.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I stepped out of my coach and onto the soil of Mercy, that distinct swampland smell filling my nostrils like mud slopping between one’s toes, I looked upon my new estate. Larger than I expected, yet still feeling unimpressive. The door hang loosely on the frame. The windows were all but shattered. Even the crows seemed to think the roof would collapse at any moment. Compared to the merchant’s manor right next door, I probably wouldn’t even be capable of giving it away to a beggar. My father most certainly hadn’t been here since our family trip eight years prior. While several of my mother’s servants brought my belongings inside I couldn’t help but feel that maybe, just maybe, I got the short end of the stick.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “So, you’re the scholar from the midlands?” a voice greeted me.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Scholar? I wouldn’t be so boastful. Who might you be and how could you be expecting me?” I say to the voice.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned to voice to find a young woman, hardly older than I. She was beautiful and mysterious. Her eyes held in them secrets kept from the world. Her hair was youthful, yet starch white. My eyes scan her from head to toe unwittingly, bringing to me the full glory of her attire; a gown of expensive dyed silks, and jewelry small enough to not be intrusive, yet visibly valuable. Her mouth was stretched into a cunning, mischievous smile as she stared at me. I stood there gawking.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I am Madam Gloria HollowWind, good sir, what might your name be?”<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “My name is Gregory Sore, Madam, seeing as you apparently knew about my arrival and occupation it surprises me that you didn’t know my name.”<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “But of course I knew your name dear,” she said, her smile growing ever more sly, “in my line of work I like to know when my associates have an alias to keep in mind. You would be surprised just how many people do.”<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at that moment that a servant came to tell me that my belongings had been all placed in the house and wished direction for my decor. “Go put on some tea, I will be in shortly.” With a bow the servant briskly made his way into the house. “Care for a cup of tea, Madam?” I asked politely as I motioned toward my abode.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I would love to, dear, but I have a council meeting to attend.”<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Surely you jest, is that not something your husband does?”<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I assure you, I am more than capable of herding a few misbegotten nobels.”<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well, I wish you best of luck, Madam.”<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “As to you. It looks as though you need more luck than I considering the state of your… house.”<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She takes her leave. The grey skies lingered above me like bittersweet rejection. The distant sound of thunder gave me more gusto for it was fortunate I arrived when I did. The gods smiled upon me.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I entered my new home with great motivation to get the place in working order. “Cancel the tea, I don’t like tea.” With a confused nod the servant making the tea understandably stopped his work and cleaned up. It was a different experience being in that room at that very time. As my eyes scanned the foyer of my home, and as I looked over each and every inch of what I now called mine, all I could see was potential. Before I knew it the servants had finished unpacking my belongings and I had unwittingly sent them home before my daydreams came to a close. My new home was still far from what I knew I could make it into, but as I sat upon that dusty worn chair with my pristine suit I knew I will make this into something of praise.</p>
