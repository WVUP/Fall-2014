Who Are the Derby Dames?
FSDD is comprised of moms, sisters, and the girl-next-door. They are local business owners, professionals, college students, and the stay at home moms who have come together to play a sport they love (usually by the end of the first practice).

<h2>Testimonials</h2>
<br>
"I love the fact that Derby has pushed me, mentally, physically and spiritually. I was never a team sport player, was never physically fit and was never in a sorority. I now feel like I have been introduced to all of those..."

"It surpasses all the stereotypical female vs. female drama. Looks and relationships and status quo have no place in it. It's about supporting each other, your team, and the game. It’s challenging; it’s fun."
<br>
~Sookie Sinsville #696sxz

 <br> 
"It's important that a woman has the opportunity to have something she can enjoy just for herself. After taking care of kids, family, clients and work, it feels amazing to put on a helmet and pads and have the outlet for the energy and the input of like-minded ladies to come together to form friendships and a fantastic team."

<h1>About Derby</h1>
<br>
<h2>What's This Derby Stuff?
</h2>
<br>
Leo A. Seltzer had a vision in 1935: an endurance race involving 25 teams roller skating on a banked track. Defensive and offensive skaters soon came into play as the competition evolved from an endurance race to a game emphasizing mainly on skaters' falls and collisions with one another, elbowing, and "whipping" and slamming each other into the track's outer rail. The transformation of the race became the game of roller derby.
 <br>
<h2>How is Roller Derby Played?
</h2>
<br>
The game is actually called a bout. The bout is a series of jams that can last up to two minutes, with 30 seconds between each jam; there are two 30 minute periods with a break between each period.
<br>
Each team has five players. The jammer they have the stars on their helmet; they score the points. The pivot they have the stripe on their helmet; they control the pack. The blockers they do not have any identifiers on their helmets; they help the jammer get through the pack.
<br>
The referee blows the whistle; the pack starts to skate; the referee blows the whistle again, then the jammers start to skate. The blockers try to block the opposing team's jammer from making their way through the pack, while propelling their own jammer forward through the pack. On the initial lap, the first jammer to pass all of the opposing team becomes lead jammer. The lead jammer can call off the jam. After the initial lap the jammers scores one point for each opposing team's players they pass. When the lead jammer calls off the jam or the two minute period ends, the jam stops and the officials calculate the score.
