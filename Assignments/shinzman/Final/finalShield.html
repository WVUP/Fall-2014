						The Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division or S.H.I.E.L.D. is a counterterrorism and intelligence agency formerly run by Nick Fury, currently being rebuilt and run by Phillip Coulson. S.H.I.E.L.D was founded after World War II by Howard Stark, Peggy Carter and Colonel Chester Phillips. S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel have access to an extensive array of cutting edge technology. S.H.I.E.L.D. maintains a fleet of Acura, Lexus, and Chevrolet vehicles for the regular deployment of field agents and scientists. S.H.I.E.L.D. vehicles are painted in black and equipped with sophisticated surveillance technology.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="charText halfHeight" >
					S.H.I.E.L.D. is directly responsible in forming the Avengers as a deterrent against Loki's plans and to help get the tessaract back into their custody. However Tony Stark, Bruce Banner and Captain America find out that S.H.I.E.L.D. wanted the tesserect in order to make weapons (similar to the way HYDRA did in World War II). Many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents watch on monitors as the Avengers fight the Chitauri in New York. Later, Director Fury tells his Superiors (known simply as the World Security Council) that he has allowed custody of the tesserect to go to Thor who has taken it back to Asgard and that the remaining Avengers have gone their separate ways and that they are no longer answering to S.H.I.E.L.D.
					<br><br>
					After the Battle of New York, the government granted S.H.I.E.L.D. more funds to invest in homeland security, for "Project Insight". Nick Fury discovered something dubious was going on and hired entire squad of pirates led by Georges Batroc to hijack the Lemurian Star, a S.H.I.E.L.D. ship related to Project Insight. During the rescue mission, Natasha Romanoff would secretly recover confidential files. Steve Rogers found Natasha extracting files from the ship's computer using a S.H.I.E.L.D. flash drive. Later, at the Triskelion, Steve confronted Nick Fury about the motives behind Natasha's task. Fury knew Steve wouldn't be comfortable with it, so he asked Natasha. Fury took Steve into an elevator down to the underground level where there were three new state-of-the-art Helicarriers being worked on as part of Project Insight, an operation that would connect the Helicarriers to spy satellites used to prevent any possible terrorist attacks. After recovering the data, Nick attempted to open the files but discovered they were sealed, even to him. He persuaded his friend and World Security Council member Alexander Pierce to delay Project Insight as he presented his suspicion that S.H.I.E.L.D. could have been compromised. Fury was soon attacked by a assassin known as The Winter Soldier. and corrupt S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. He barely escaped alive and made it to Steve's apartment, where he told Steve that S.H.I.E.L.D. was compromised and should trust no one. Before being gunned down by the Winter Soldier, who had tracked him down, Fury gave Steve a flash drive with the confidential files. Following Fury's apparent demise, Pierce talked with Steve, and discovered he had hid something from him. Pierce deployed the Strike team to capture him, but Steve fought them off and went into hiding along with Natasha. Both Steve and Natasha discover that HYDRA has secretly operated within S.H.I.E.L.D. for decades. HYDRA plan to use the Insight Helicarriers with Zola's algorithm found on the Lemurian Star, to target and kill millions of people selected by Zola's algorithm, any individual which would pose a threat to HYDRA. It was later revealed that Fury had faked his death by using a drug developed as a heart-rate suppressant by Bruce Banner. Fury retreated with Maria Hill to a secret location so that he could heal. The two of them then accompanied Steve, Natasha and Sam Wilson to infiltrate the Triskelion and destroy Project Insight. Fury intended to save S.H.I.E.L.D. but Steve firmly insisted that the organization be dismantled after all the corruption it had fallen under. Steve, with the help of Sam and Maria Hill, break into the Triskelion and take control of the Insight Helicarriers with microphones. They tell the staff that there are HYDRA agents in S.H.I.E.L.D and that Alexander Pierce is their leader and that they cannot initiate Project Insight. They manage to put the chips in the Helicarriers. After the battle, S.H.I.E.L.D. is disbanded and disavowed by its commanding governments.

						A son of Robert and Julie Coulson, Phil Coulson was born in Boston, MA, on July 8, 1964. Coulson grew up being a huge fan of Captain America, and collected a set of vintage Captain America cards over the course of two years. Coulson lost his father at a very young age, and his mother is now deceased as well. Coulson was recruited directly out of high school to S.H.I.E.L.D. by Nick Fury. Fury served as his training officer. Coulson trained alongside John Garrett. Coulson eventually became a legendary agent within S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of Director Fury's most trusted agents.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="charText halfHeight" >
					When a threat to the world required the formation of a team of Super Heroes to defeat it, Coulson took on the task of assembling Nick Fury's Avengers as just another day at the office. He managed to convince Tony Stark to join the team, with the help of Pepper Potts, whom he befriended during his assignment to Stark. Back on the Helicarrier, Coulson was more than happy to meet his all-time hero, Captain America, who had joined the Avengers Initiative on Fury's invitation. Coulson asked Rogers to sign some vintage collectible sticker cards he'd gathered in around two years, stressing the fact that Rogers had always been a model for him. After the team's first mission, Coulson told Fury that the team was not prepared to face the common menace, and that they needed to be motivated some way. Stark managed to capture Loki Laufeyson and bring him to the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier, when a brainwashed Clint Barton attacked and Loki was able to break free. Coulson reached Loki's prison, only to find the villain out of his cage, and Thor trapped in his place. The agent threatened Loki with a weapon, Coulson's Revenge, created from The Destroyer's body, but the Asgardian teleported and stabbed him through his back by using his staff. Lying on the floor, Coulson was powerless to prevent Thor's expulsion from the Helicarrier, but managed to land a blow on Loki with the Revenge. Later, when the battle was over and lost, Fury reached Coulson just in time to hear his last words. As he died, Phil suggested Fury use his death to motivate the Avengers into working together as a team. Coulson's death had a large effect on the team who became saddened or enraged in some way, but Phil's death would be the final motivator for the Avengers founding. Later, Tony Stark acknowledged his friendship with Phil while confronting Loki, stating that there was one more person he pissed off; "His name was Phil."
					<br><br>
					Coulson was revived several days after his death, under Nick Fury's orders, using GH.325 and the T.A.H.I.T.I. project. During the process, they altered some of his memories to make him believe that he was revived in Tahiti, in order to cope with the pain he felt and to make him less suicidal, as he wanted to die due to the intense agony he was experiencing. He then had to work through his memories to find which were real and which were fake. Despite the common belief that he had died, Coulson returned to active duty some time after the Battle of New York. He assembled a team consisting of agents Melinda May and Grant Ward, biochemist Jemma Simmons and engineer Leo Fitz, and hacktivist Skye. Coulson and Maria Hill later explained to Agent Ward that Fury "faked Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers"; Coulson claimed that he "stopped breathing for about forty seconds," though Hill indicated that Coulson was clinically dead for just eight seconds before being revived. He then spent time recovering in "a grass shack in Tahiti," which he described as "a magical place"; the story of Coulson's survival, however, is a fabrication, of which Coulson himself is unaware. After Coulson's departure, in response to one of Coulson's remarks about Tahiti, Dr. Streiten remarked to Maria Hill, "Tahiti? He really doesn't know, does he?" Hill responds that "He can never know."

						The daughter of Lian May, an intelligence operative, Melinda May joined S.H.I.E.L.D., believing that the agency is the best defense of the United States of America and the world against any possible threat. At some point she became married, though what brought an end to her marriage is not known. Trained by the best S.H.I.E.L.D. has to offer, she became an ace pilot and a weapons expert, a soldier who can perform above and beyond the call of duty. She's one of the few S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who has more black belts than the notorious Natasha Romanoff, whom she met and befriended.

				<div class="charText halfHeight" >
					She became a colleague of Agent Phil Coulson. During her time as a field agent, she was assigned a case where some superhumans had kidnapped a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in a compound. May went in alone, and through some unknown means, "resolved the situation", getting the captured agents out. Her actions got her commendation and she was nicknamed "the Cavalry". However, traumatized by what she had done, she requested reassignment to a quiet desk job in recent years. When Agent Coulson was given permission to start a team for special assignments May was one of the first he recruited under the promise that she would only be "driving the Bus". This proved false as she was forced to use her field experience once again in their first few missions. Agent May was revealed to have been communicating directly with Director Fury, providing status updates on the team. Agent May has been involved behind the scenes with the creation of Coulson's team from the beginning, including drawing up the team itself (and passing it off to Fury), as well as knowledge of TAHITI. May helped put together the team, by essentially guiding Coulson to choose the people she would need, including the tech-bio combo of Fitz and Simmons and Ward as a specialist, if it became necessary to put Coulson down.

						Daisy Johnson, better known as Skye and legally known as Mary Sue Poots, is a genius-level hacker and S.H.I.E.L.D. operative. She was fathered by Calvin Zabo, a doctor working in China, and mothered by a seemingly immortal woman, the latter of whom was killed by HYDRA after her birth. Growing up an orphan juggled around by S.H.I.E.L.D., she adopted the name Skye and worked for the Rising Tide "hacktivist" group so she could reveal the truth about the existence of aliens, superheroes, and demigods to the world. 
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="charText halfHeight" >
					When she appeared on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar, Phil Coulson recruited her into his team. However, the real reason why she agreed to join S.H.I.E.L.D. was to discover the truth about her lost parents. She joined them as a consultant, becoming a valued member of the team throughout the course of their missions. Skye finally gained official S.H.I.E.L.D. membership just before the hunt for the Clairvoyant. The team found a lead to the whereabouts of the Clairvoyant through a Mr. Ian Quinn. Tracking a mysterious package that Quinn acquired from Cybertek Technologies, the team went undercover and boarded the train transferring the package to Quinn's care. However, the team was jeopardized by Luca Russo, and Cybertek sent operatives to neutralize the team. In the ensuing chaos, the group was separated, and only Skye and Leo Fitz were left to pursue Quinn. The pair arrived at Quinn's compound, where Skye proceeded inside alone and was shocked to find Michael Peterson, still alive but horribly scarred. She attempted to get Peterson to escape with her, but unknown to her, Peterson was being controlled by the Clairvoyant through a Backscatter X-Ray Eye Implant, and the package was actually a high-tech prosthetic leg that was subsequently attached on Peterson's limb. Skye attempted to stop Quinn, but was shot twice in the stomach. Close to death, she crawled to the door and called for help, but was unable to call loud enough. She was eventually found by Phil Coulson and saved at the last minute by her team, who sustained her condition by placing her inside of a Hyperbaric Chamber. Shortly after being shot, the team took her to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trauma Zentrum in Switzerland, where despite the doctors' best efforts, her injuries were too severe and there was nothing more they could do other than keep her comfortable. Desperate, Coulson decided to take Skye to the location where he was brought back from the dead. After some research, the team located a secret facility known as The Guest House. With the help of Agent John Garrett, Grant Ward's former S.O., the group managed to retrieve GH.325, a drug that seemingly regenerates damaged cells. Right after the drug was administrated, Coulson arrived warning not to give Skye the drug, as he discovered in the compound that the drug is made from the bodily fluids of a blue alien corpse hidden inside the base. After initial shock and struggle, Skye managed to recover thanks to the effects of the drug.
					<br><br>
					During Skye's recovery, the team joined forces with the Asgardian Sif in taking down Lorelei. After that situation had been dealt with, Coulson revealed to Skye the true nature of the drug, and the two decided to work together to find the secret behind it without telling the rest of the team. 
					<br><br>
					After the events of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Civil War had passed, she joined the rest of her team in going off the grid. Skye was devastated when she learned that fellow agent Grant Ward was an agent of HYDRA, and she joined the team in defeating the Centipede Project and John Garrett. When Agent Coulson became the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Skye, along with the rest of the team, went with him to begin rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. She worked to stop HYDRA in the following months, eventually leading her to discovering the truth behind her origin. In the series of events that followed, Skye reunited with her father. She discovered the alien-based origin of her mother's lineage, and, after a grueling altercation against Daniel Whitehall's forces, Skye was exposed to the Diviner, granting her earthquake generating abilities.

						Leopold Fitz was born in Scotland, United Kingdom, and not much has been revealed about his childhood. His only other known relative is his mother. In 2004 Fitz went to the S.H.I.E.L.D. training academy with his best friend, Biochem genius Jemma Simmons. Among their instructors were Professor Vaughn and Professor Hall, who taught chemical kinetics during their second year.However both graduated from the academy three years early. Sometime after they graduated from college, Jemma dragged Fitz into going on a field assignment which was join Coulson Team.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="charText halfHeight" >
					Leo and Jemma were recruited by agent Phil Coulson to be the science crew for a new team he was putting together. Stationed on the Bus, the pair have designed specialized equipment and compounds on the fly in various emergency situations. Their first foray into the field involved the case of Michael Peterson, a man in danger of exploding due to his use of the volatile Centipede formula. Peterson was saved in part by Fitz's efforts to create a Centipede counter-agent for Peterson.
					<br><br>
					Fitz faced danger in the field in Peru, where the team was investigating an 0-8-4. Fitz and the team escaped Peruvian rebels only to face an armed takeover of the Bus. Working with the team, he helped take back the Bus and secure the old HYDRA weapon. Soon afterwards, Jemma Simmons was infected by a Chitauri helmet virus. He tried extremely hard to find an anti-serum, and he did in the end, but Jemma didn't know. Jemma hit Fitz on the back of the head with a fire extinguisher so she could jump from the 'Bus' to save the others, without Fitz following her. Fitz tried to parachute after her, but Grant Ward beat him to it. Fitz showed remorse that he wasn't the one to rescue Jemma after the events. Nevertheless, Jemma thanked him and kisses him on the cheek.
					<br><br>
					Fitz went into the field with Ward afterwards. The mission was to destroy a weapon called the "Overkill Device " that was able to make weapons go off at a great distance. However, there was no extraction plan. Fitz proved his bravery in this episode over and over, ultimately helping Ward fight their enemies. Coulson and the rest of the team evacuated Fitz and Ward once they did their job. After returing from Portland, Fitz and the others find out their team is missing and Fitz later discovers a message left by Skye saying Ward is Hydra. When Simmons's autopsy report proved Ward had killed Eric Koenig, Fitz had a tantrum and had to be calmed by Coulson. After meeting Glenn Talbot at the Providence base, Fitz and the others escaped to Los Angeles where they rescued Skye from Ward. After his very near-death experience at the hands of Ward in the final episodes of Season One, Fitz is alive, but nothing much more, judging by Simmons's state and statements to the reformed S.H.I.E.L.D. team at the Playground.
					<br><br>
					Fitz is shown to have gaps in his vocabulary and loss of certain fine motor skills because he was deprived of oxygen while escaping from the ocean. He is also on a regime of medication. It is revealed at the end of "Shadows" that the Simmons seen onscreen is in fact a construct of Fitz's imagination, since she left in reality to try to compel him to recover on his own. Coulson gave Fitz the task of building cloaking technology for the bus. Fitz recognized the Overkill Device with the help of Mack. They modify device in order to stop Creel When Donnie Gill, a former student of SHIELD Academy whom Fitz befriended, appeared in Morocco, Coulson and the others tried to head there before Hydra got to him. Fitz was upset that he was not going with the rest of the team. He went to the Vault D that held Grant Ward. He was shocked to see Ward in the Vault and had not been told of his presence. Ward attempted to convince Fitz that he was not trying to kill he and Simmons, and Fitz responds by turning down the oxygen levels in Ward's cell.

						A bio-chem genius with two PhDs, Jemma Simmons attended the S.H.I.E.L.D. training academy with her best friend, engineering genius Leo Fitz. Among their instructors were Professor Vaughn[2] and Professor Hall, who taught chemical kinetics during their second year. Wanting to see more than the inside of a lab, and against the advice of Professor Vaughn, Jemma convinced Leo to seek out a field assignment.

				<div class="charText halfHeight" >
					Jemma and Fitz were recruited by agent Phil Coulson to be the science crew for a new team he was putting together, although it has since been claimed by May that she was, in fact, responsible for their inclusion. Stationed on the Bus, the pair have designed specialized equipment and compounds on the fly in various emergency situations. Their first foray into the field involved the case of Michael Peterson, a man in danger of exploding due to his use of the volatile Centipede formula. Peterson was saved in part by Jemma's efforts to create a Centipede counter-agent for Peterson. Jemma first faced danger in the field in Peru, where the team was investigating an 0-8-4. She and the team escaped Peruvian rebels only to face an armed takeover of the Bus. Working with the team, she helped take back the Bus and secure the old Hydra weapon. While investigating a mysterious death in Pennsylvania, Jemma was infected with a fatal alien virus passed along from a Chitauri helmet. After what appeared to be a final failed attempt at a cure, Jemma threw herself from the Bus in flight in order save her team from the virus' effect. Fortunately for her, the cure was actually effective and teammate Grant Ward caught her in mid-flight, injected her with the antiserum, and parachuted them to safety.
					<br><br>
					In "Shadows" Coulson reveals that she has left the team, at least in part in the hope that forcing Fitz to recover without her will speed the process. It has, unfortunately, had the opposite effect, and her former partner is hallucinating her continuing presence. Despite appearing to have quit the team, she in fact was sent by Coulson to infiltrate HYDRA.
